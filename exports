These files center around the candidate regions Cdkn1c and Kcnq1ot1 in a promoter-driven screen, consistent with the imprinting literature. For more powerful statistics, it is possible to increase the number of permutations in dmrseq or to screen outside the promoter. I took permutation 1 in this workflow.
